# Enron-POI-detection
 Identifying persons of interest through a simple ML based anomaly detection algorithm enhanced with communication network/graph structure.

$Y_{i \rightarrow j} = f_\theta \left( X_{i \rightarrow j} \right)$<br>
$where f_\theta is the isolation forest model.$<br>
$And, Y_{i \rightarrow j} \text{is the output(anomaly score) from the isolation forest model for an edge of the communication network with feature vector } X_{i \rightarrow j}$<br>
